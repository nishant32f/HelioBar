# HelioBar

A native macOS **menu bar app** that shows your **live heart rate** from an
[Amazfit Helio Strap](https://us.amazfit.com/products/helio-strap) — read directly
over Bluetooth, no cloud, no account, nothing leaves your Mac.

The strap broadcasts heart rate over the standard BLE Heart Rate service, and
HelioBar reads it straight from CoreBluetooth.

## Features

- **Live HR in the menu bar** — the number, zone-tinted (green / orange / red) with a trend arrow (`♥ 84 ↑`)
- **Dropdown** with a live HR **sparkline**, session **min / avg / max**, a **time-in-zone** bar, and **% of max HR**
- **Personalized zones** — set your age; zones scale to your estimated max HR (≈ 220 − age)
- **Elevated-HR alerts** — a macOS notification when your HR stays above a threshold for N minutes (a desk-stress nudge)
- **Breathing biofeedback** — a guided inhale/exhale timer, inline in the dropdown, so you can watch your HR settle in real time
- **Launch at login**, no Dock icon, App Sandbox on

## Requirements

- macOS 14+ (built with Xcode 26 / Swift 6)
- An Amazfit Helio Strap (or any device that broadcasts the standard BLE Heart Rate service `0x180D`)

## Setup

1. In the **Zepp** app: Device → Helio Strap → Health Monitoring → enable **Heart Rate Push**.
   This makes the strap broadcast HR over standard BLE.
2. Launch HelioBar and **allow Bluetooth** when prompted.
3. The menu bar number goes live within a few seconds.

> **Notch tip:** on a crowded notch-MacBook menu bar, the icon can land *under* the
> notch. Hold **⌘** and drag it out to the right — macOS remembers the spot.

## Build & install

```bash
brew install xcodegen          # one-time
git clone https://github.com/TirthCodes/HelioBar.git
cd HelioBar
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme HelioBar -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build build
cp -R build/Build/Products/Release/HelioBar.app /Applications/
open /Applications/HelioBar.app
```

Run the logic tests with `cd HelioCore && swift test`.

## Architecture

- **`HelioCore/`** — a Swift package with the pure, unit-tested logic: `HealthStore`
  (the single source of truth), the BLE Heart Rate packet parser, HR-zone math, and the
  elevated-HR alert engine. Run via `swift test`.
- **`HelioBarApp/`** — the macOS app target (generated with XcodeGen): an AppKit
  `NSStatusItem` + `NSPopover` driving SwiftUI views, and a CoreBluetooth `HeartRateMonitor`.
  The menu bar uses AppKit (not SwiftUI's `MenuBarExtra`) because `NSStatusItem` survives
  sleep/wake reliably.

The UI only ever reads `HealthStore`; the BLE monitor pushes into it. Each piece has one job
and is testable in isolation.

## Notes

- HRV isn't supported: the strap's BLE broadcast sends only the averaged BPM, not the
  beat-to-beat (RR) intervals HRV requires.
- Stress / energy / readiness need the Zepp cloud, which this app intentionally avoids.
  Earlier commits explored a (working) cloud integration; it was removed to keep HelioBar
  fully local. It's in the git history if you want it.
